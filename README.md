# Bio-SNP-TOPBOT
Bio::SNP::TOPBOT, Perl module to determine strand of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using Illumina's TOP/BOT designation. 

Some understanding of how Perl finds modules may help to use this software. Note that the TOPBOT.pm file will need to be in a Perl module directory under subdirectories Bio/SNP/, in Linux and Mac OS X this can be set by:
export PERL5LIB:"Path to module directory":$PERL5LIB
